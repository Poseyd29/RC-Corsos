                <p class="pfont-style">We began the process of breeding Cane Corso's back in 2019 when we fell in love with this breed. The presence,
                    and stature of Corso's are awe inspiring, but the gentleness these dogs display completely sold us, and
                    here we are now. We do this for the love of the breed and for the enjoyment we get from it.</p>

                <h1 class="welcome-h1">My Experience</h1>

                <p class="pfont-style">These dogs are very special to us, and we consider them an integral part of our family. The love we give
                    them is returned many times over by their loyalty and devotion. The children have fallen in love with
                    our gentle Corso's. Strangers come to love our Corso's as well despite their ability to protect a home.
                    These dogs are an absolute pleasure to be around at all times, and we are sure you will feel the same
                    way! </p>

                <h1 class="welcome-h1">Our Mission</h1>

                <p class="pfont-style">We are truly committed to bettering the Cane Corso breed, and consider ourselves privileged to experience
                    the important moments with this breed that make us fall in love with the Cane Corso over again each day.
                    We strive to provide healthy, social, and well-trained pups that will be a wonderful addition to any
                    family!</p>
